Edit IB.py file especially for the section in line 81 and 82, use your instagram account. In this code, I use the windows environ as the variable for my instagram account.
Then, edit the hashtag in line 86. You can also use the list as paramater for the hashtag, the example put in the comment.

1. Use Selenium library to run the bot on the browser.
2. Time library, as the time management.
3. Random library to obtain the random value. 
3. os library to make the variable in windows.
